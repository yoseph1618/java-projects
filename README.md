# java-projects
A repo of a lot of simple JavaScript projects that I have created.  The range of complexity for these projects will be large as some may be simple buttons and others may be entire applications.

Dice-randomRoll:
This has a button representing a six sided dice that tracks all numbers rolled and allows the user to click the dice or square button to generate the numbers and see the number last rolled displayed in the center of it.
