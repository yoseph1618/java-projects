# Player Timer #
This is a player timer I designed for D&D.  This will keep track of how long each player has been doing things or "had the floor" to make sure each player gets an even amount of time playing.

## How to use ##
Simply add the name of the player in the prompt, then click Add Timer.  It will create a small box with their name at the top, their timer in the middle, and the play/pause button at the bottom.  You can add as many timers as you would like!  Only one timer can run at a time.
